# Questionnaire Critique – Uber Customer Satisfaction Survey
---

## Overview

This critique focuses on a real-world customer feedback form used by Uber after a completed ride. The survey typically appears within the app and asks users to rate their experience.

## Format and Layout

**Strengths:**
- The interface is mobile-friendly and minimalistic, reducing friction for users.
- Key metrics (rating out of 5 stars, ride safety, driver professionalism) are prioritized.
- Use of visual icons (e.g., stars) makes interaction intuitive and quick.

**Weaknesses:**
- The questionnaire appears immediately after the ride, which could bias results due to recency effect or emotional response.
- Some options are hidden under “More” or “Other” categories, which may discourage users from elaborating.

## Question Design Analysis

| Question                                                                                                                        | Critique                                                 | Purpose/Issues                                                  | Suggested Improvements                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. How would you rate your ride? (1–5 stars)**                                                                                | Effective, simple, widely understood                     | Captures overall satisfaction, but lacks detail                 | Consider follow-up conditional questions for ratings < 3                         |
| **2. What did you like or dislike about your ride? (Select all that apply: Cleanliness, Driving, Safety, Friendliness, Other)** | Checkbox format is efficient, but lacks open-ended depth | Encourages categorical feedback but not detailed reasoning      | Add optional text box per choice for qualitative input                           |
| **3. Would you like the same driver again? (Yes/No)**                                                                           | Too binary for nuanced responses                         | Oversimplifies user sentiment                                   | Include a Likert scale or “Maybe” option                                         |
| **4. Was your pickup smooth? (Yes/No)**                                                                                         | Lacks specificity – what defines “smooth”?               | Ambiguous phrasing leads to inconsistent interpretation         | Rephrase as “Did the driver arrive on time and find you easily?”                 |
| **5. Do you have any additional feedback? (Open text)**                                                                         | Useful but placed at the end; often skipped              | Captures qualitative detail but placement reduces response rate | Move earlier for engaged users; include prompt like “e.g. how we could improve?” |


## General Critique

- Leading Bias: Some questions (e.g., “What did you like?”) assume a positive experience. This could bias responses and exclude negative feedback.
- Length: The survey is short, which supports high completion rates but limits insight depth.
- Missing Demographics: No segmentation data (e.g., age, gender, ride frequency) is collected, which could inform experience differentiation.

## Recommendations for Improvement

- Use conditional logic to display more detailed questions based on low ratings.
- Improve neutrality in phrasing to avoid bias (e.g., change “What did you like?” to “What aspects of the ride stood out?”).
- Enable ranking of selected feedback items to prioritize importance.
- Consider timing: Allow users to complete the survey later via email notification or app reminder when they’re less emotionally influenced.
- Add optional demographic filters (with consent) to personalize data analytics and improve experience for different user groups.

## Conclusion

While Uber’s post-ride survey is efficient and user-friendly, it prioritizes completion rate over data richness. With thoughtful changes to the format and question design, it could become a more powerful tool for both qualitative and quantitative feedback analysis.
