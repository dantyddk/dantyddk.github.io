## **Case Study Discussion: Ethical Dilemma in Statistical Reporting**

Abi faces a significant ethical dilemma when the data he collected shows that Whizzz cereal may be harmful. Although he could perform additional analyses to portray the product more favorably, selective analysis—even without manipulating data—violates the principles of transparency and objectivity in research (Resnik, 2015). Selective reporting, often referred to as p-hacking, can mislead stakeholders and the public (Head et al., 2015).

According to the American Statistical Association (ASA, 2018), statisticians must ensure that their analyses are honest and fully disclose limitations, assumptions, and alternative interpretations. Presenting only favorable results undermines scientific integrity and risks public harm, particularly since Whizzz directly impacts consumer health.

Abi is ethically obligated to present both positive and negative findings to provide a complete and accurate picture (ICMJE, 2019). Comprehensive reporting supports informed decision-making and reflects the ethical principle of beneficence (Beauchamp & Childress, 2019).

While Abi may not control how the manufacturer uses the findings, he holds responsibility for foreseeable misuse (National Academies, 2017). To mitigate this risk, Abi could include disclaimers, recommend independent review, or even withdraw from the project if misuse seems inevitable (Johnson, 2003).

Legally, selective reporting that leads to public harm may violate consumer protection laws in many jurisdictions, including the U.S., EU, and Vietnam. Socially, misleading health claims could erode public trust and harm vulnerable consumers.

Ultimately, Abi must prioritize ethical standards, professional integrity, and public welfare over client interests.

## **Case Study Discussion: Ethical Dilemma in Statistical Reporting**

Reflecting on my initial post and the insightful peer responses, Abi’s data indicate that Whizzz cereal may be harmful, yet the manufacturer pressures him to emphasize only favorable results. Even without falsifying data, selective analysis or p-hacking undermines transparency and can mislead stakeholders (Head et al., 2015; Huff, 1954).

The American Statistical Association requires statisticians to disclose all assumptions, limitations, and alternative interpretations to maintain objectivity (ASA, 2018). Likewise, the ICMJE insists on full reporting of both positive and negative findings to uphold research integrity (ICMJE, 2019). By omitting adverse results, Abi would violate these professional standards and risk public harm, especially when consumer health is involved (Resnik, 2015).

Although Abi cannot entirely control how his analysis is used, he remains responsible for foreseeable misuse (National Academies, 2017). Peers recommend including clear disclaimers or seeking an independent review, and, if necessary, withdrawing from the project or whistleblowing (Johnson, 2003).

Selective reporting that endangers consumers may also breach consumer protection laws in jurisdictions like the U.S., EU, and Vietnam. Above all, Abi’s foremost obligation is beneficence: prioritizing public welfare and scientific honesty over client demands (Beauchamp & Childress, 2019).
