# Reflective Response – Research Methods and Planning
---

Reflecting on my chosen project topic, “The Use of Dashboards in Current Business Practice in the Ride-Hailing Sector,” I believe that a qualitative research approach—specifically a case study method—would be best suited to my purpose. This is because my focus is on understanding how dashboards are designed, used, and perceived in real business environments, particularly within ride-hailing companies such as Be Group or Grab. According to Yin (2018), case studies are highly appropriate when exploring complex real-life applications, especially when the boundaries between context and phenomena are blurred, as is the case in dashboard usage across departments (marketing, operations, product teams).

## Suitable Research Methods

From this week’s reading, a mixed-method approach may also add value, particularly by combining qualitative insights from interviews or observations with quantitative data such as usage logs or performance metrics. However, since the study is exploratory and context-driven, the qualitative emphasis remains central. The interpretivist paradigm aligns well with my goal of understanding subjective experiences and organizational routines surrounding dashboards.

## Data Collection Methods

I would consider the following data collection methods:
- Semi-structured interviews – to gather insights from business analysts, product managers, and operations leads about how they use dashboards, what challenges they face, and what decisions are influenced by dashboard data.
- Document analysis – of dashboard reports, internal SOPs, or training manuals to better understand their intended design and usage.
- Observations or screen recordings – if possible, observing how stakeholders interact with dashboards during meetings or operations reviews could reveal important HCI and workflow-related findings.
- Secondary data – from published case studies, whitepapers, or internal data logs related to dashboard usage frequency or user behavior patterns.
- Combining these methods will allow me to triangulate insights and build a robust understanding of dashboard utility in ride-hailing operations.

## Required and Developing Skills

- To effectively conduct this project, I will need to strengthen several core skills:
- Qualitative analysis: Skills in coding interview transcripts and identifying themes using software such as NVivo or Atlas.ti will be crucial.
- Interviewing techniques: I will need to develop strong interviewing skills to elicit detailed, honest, and actionable insights from participants.
- Data visualization literacy: Although I am already familiar with platforms like Tableau, I must deepen my understanding of how users interpret visual components—this ties directly into HCI principles.
- Critical thinking and synthesis: To evaluate and compare academic literature, I must apply critical thinking to identify gaps, contradictions, and emerging trends.

## Final Thoughts

This project will likely involve both interpretative depth and practical relevance, requiring an interdisciplinary blend of IT, business, and human-centered research methods. Through this approach, I aim to deliver findings that not only contribute to academic understanding but also offer practical implications for dashboard design and adoption in the ride-hailing industry.
