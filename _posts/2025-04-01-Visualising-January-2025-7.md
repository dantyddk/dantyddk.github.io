## Wekly Performance by Persona Tag in Ride-Hailing Company
---
### Introduction

In Vietnam’s fast-growing ride-hailing market, user behavior is constantly evolving. To sustain growth and improve decision-making, companies must deeply understand their customers and continuously monitor operational metrics. Our company, which offers both Bike and Car services nationwide, has invested in a segmentation-based performance dashboard to track weekly user activity and support strategic initiatives across business units.
This report outlines the purpose, design methodology, and key components of the dashboard we developed to evaluate user segmentation performance. Designed for use by both business and technical stakeholders, this dashboard plays a vital role in transforming complex user data into actionable insights. 

### Dashboard Design Method

The dashboard was developed using Tableau, a leading data visualization tool chosen for its flexibility, interactivity, and scalability. Tableau enables our team to create a centralized platform where performance metrics can be viewed and explored from multiple dimensions, allowing various departments such as marketing, operations, and product to use the same data but extract insights relevant to their needs.
Our primary goal was to create a dashboard that is not only visually intuitive but also capable of delivering granular insights on user segmentation. It supports weekly updates, enabling near real-time monitoring of behavioral trends and revenue performance.

### Dashboard Information

#### 1.	Overall Dashboard Concept

The core purpose of the dashboard is to serve as a performance monitoring and behavioral diagnostic tool for internal teams. The intended audience includes:
-	Marketing teams, who need to understand user personas and spending levels to design targeted promotions.
-	Operations teams, who require insights into service usage patterns to optimize supply-demand balance.
-	Product managers, who monitor user engagement and retention metrics for feature development.
-	Business leaders, who seek high-level overviews of segment performance and revenue trends.
By consolidating performance data into a single view with interactive filters, the dashboard supports cross-functional collaboration and fast decision-making.

#### 2.	Dashboard Details

The dashboard offers several key features and components that allow users to explore and analyze performance data by week, city, service type, and user characteristics.

##### 2.1. Filters
A set of global filters enables users to narrow down data according to:
-	City: View performance in specific locations
-	Service Type: Bike or Car
-	Week of Performance: Allows time-based trend analysis
-	User Segment: Retain (active users) or Churn (inactive users)
-	Persona: Office Worker, Student, Shopertainer, On-demand User
-	Spending Level: From Level 1 (highest spenders) to Level 5 (lowest)
These filters are essential for comparative analysis and micro-targeting, helping teams to answer specific business questions quickly.

##### 2.2. Overall Performance Summary
This section presents a table of key metrics, including:
-	Active Riders: Users with at least one trip during the selected week
-	Trips: Total rides completed
-	Gross Merchandise Value (GMV): Total revenue generated
-	Requests: Total service requests, regardless of fulfillment
This summary gives a high-level snapshot of weekly performance and enables week-to-week comparisons.

##### 2.3. Trendline Analysis by Persona
Using a set of line charts, this section visualizes the progression of each metric by persona type over time. It helps stakeholders detect seasonal shifts, emerging trends, or sudden changes in user behavior.
For example, a drop in GMV among Shopertainers might signal reduced mall traffic, while a spike in On-demand users may indicate a short-term campaign’s success.

##### 2.4. Spending Level Distribution
A bar chart illustrates the distribution of users across spending levels within each persona group. This view provides insight into:
-	Which personas contribute the most revenue.
-	Where upselling opportunities exist.
-	Whether the business relies too heavily on a specific spending tier.

##### 2.5. Preferred Service Distribution
A tree map (square map) visualizes users' preferred service (Bike or Car) within each spending level and persona. This is particularly useful for:
-	Allocating vehicle supply by user preference
-	Identifying pricing sensitivity by service type
-	Planning region-specific or persona-targeted promotions

##### 2.6. Persona Contribution Table
This table presents the percentage contribution of each persona to overall performance across all core metrics. It highlights how different user types contribute to:
-	Total active user base
-	Revenue (GMV)
-	Ride volume
These insights help identify high-impact user groups, validate campaign targeting, and inform investment priorities.

### CONCLUSION
The user segmentation performance dashboard offers a powerful lens into our business operations. By combining behavioral, transactional, and demographic layers, we gain a richer understanding of who our users are, how they engage with our services, and what drives their value.

This dashboard not only supports weekly tracking of retention, spending, and usage trends, but also enables stakeholders across functions to align around shared goals. Its design encourages data exploration, supports evidence-based decision-making, and promotes user-centric strategies.

As we continue to scale and evolve, we aim to enhance the dashboard further by integrating predictive analytics, churn forecasting, and real-time alerts, ensuring that we remain agile and responsive in a highly competitive market.
