# The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing
---

Both deduction and induction are forms of inference, which means reaching a conclusion based on evidence and reasoning. However, as the diagram shows, deduction moves you (the researcher) from an idea to an observation, while induction takes you from an observation to an idea.

Deduction can get you to a perfect conclusion, but only if all your assumptions are 100% correct. Therefore, researchers in a non-lab/scientific setting would find deduction more difficult to use because it is often difficult to find a set of fully agreed-upon facts on which to structure their arguments.

On the other hand, induction is used more frequently to solve everyday problems. It is particularly useful for problems that involve partial information about a situation or activity and the conclusions may not always be right, but they are more practical.

Before delving further into the research process, it is essential to develop an understanding of research ethics. Ethics is an area is of importance when conducting any piece of research, particularly where people may be involved.

## What did I learn?

Through this week’s activity, I learned the distinction between deductive and inductive reasoning in scientific investigation. Deduction starts from a general idea and leads to a specific conclusion, while induction begins with observations and moves toward forming a general theory. I also deepened my understanding of research ethics, especially the importance of safeguarding human participants, ensuring transparency, and being aware of potential bias in research design. Completing the quiz gave me hands-on reinforcement of these concepts by applying them to practical examples.

## Why did I learn it?

This knowledge is essential because it forms the foundation of scientific and ethical research methodology. In data science and computing, we constantly make inferences from data—both deductively when applying models, and inductively when analyzing user behavior or patterns. Understanding how to reason correctly and ethically ensures that my work remains valid, reliable, and responsible—especially when using data related to real people.

## How will I apply it in real life?

In my role as a business analyst and as a Master’s student in data science, I frequently draw conclusions based on user data, product metrics, and market behavior. I will apply inductive reasoning to detect behavioral trends and deductive logic when designing user segmentation rules or validating assumptions in algorithms. Additionally, I will apply research ethics when working with any datasets that include personally identifiable information (PII) or affect users’ experiences. This includes anonymizing data, gaining informed consent in research, and evaluating the societal impact of my findings.

## How will I improve? (Action Plan)

Although I scored full marks on the reasoning quiz, I aim to improve by practicing the application of these reasoning types in more complex contexts, such as real-world business cases and algorithm design. My benchmark is to critically assess reasoning in all my analytical work, especially when designing A/B tests or performance models. I will also continue studying case studies on ethics in computing to internalize professional standards. Reading further on research methodology and ethical guidelines from ACM and BCS will help me maintain high standards.

## What were my feelings, inspiration, or motivation?

I felt confident completing the quiz, as the visual explanations of reasoning styles were intuitive and practical. This learning inspired me to reflect on how often we make assumptions in business or research without fully understanding the type of logic we’re using. I am motivated to be more conscious of the reasoning and ethical frameworks behind the data-driven decisions I make at work and in academia.

## What were the challenges I faced?

The main challenge was understanding the practical boundaries between induction and deduction, especially in grey-area examples. For instance, assumptions that seem universal may not always be valid, making deductive conclusions vulnerable. Also, ethical research in computing is a broad and evolving topic; staying updated with frameworks and ensuring compliance is an ongoing responsibility. I plan to address this by attending seminars and reading more on applied AI ethics and responsible data science practices.
