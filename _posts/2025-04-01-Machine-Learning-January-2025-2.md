Criteria	Ryanair	EasyJet

Discussion

1. Attributes Examined: Both websites focus on essential travel-related attributes. Ryanair highlights cheap flight destinations, pricing, and promotional offers (Ryanair, 2024), while EasyJet emphasizes its route map and flight options (EasyJet, 2024). Users on both platforms are primarily interested in flight availability, pricing, and destination information

2. Tasks Undertaken: Viewers on Ryanair's site typically search for affordable flights, explore promotional deals, and complete bookings (Ryanair, 2024). EasyJet users engage with the interactive route map to explore potential destinations and compare routes before booking flights (EasyJet, 2024).

3. Data Representation: Ryanair uses a straightforward list format for destinations and pricing, complemented by interactive route maps (Ryanair, 2024). EasyJet excels with an interactive, clickable route map, making it easy for users to visualize available destinations (EasyJet, 2024). Both sites employ effective visual tools, but EasyJet’s use of interactive maps offers a more engaging user experience.

4. Colour Schema: Ryanair employs a blue and yellow colour scheme, reflecting its brand identity (Ryanair, 2024), while EasyJet uses orange and white, consistent with its branding (EasyJet, 2024). Both colour schemes are effective in maintaining brand recognition and providing a visually coherent experience.

5. Strengths and Limitations: Ryanair’s strengths lie in its clear pricing information and straightforward navigation, though it lacks advanced visual appeal and can be text-heavy (Ryanair, 2024). EasyJet offers an intuitive and visually appealing route map, but detailed pricing is less immediately accessible, and navigation can be slightly complex (EasyJet, 2024).

6. Visualisation Perspective: From a visualisation perspective, Ryanair provides functional but basic visual elements, ensuring clarity in data presentation (Ryanair, 2024). EasyJet stands out with its strong visual design and interactive maps, enhancing user engagement and exploration (EasyJet, 2024).

Conclusion

Both Ryanair and EasyJet effectively use data visualisation to meet user needs. Ryanair prioritizes functional clarity and straightforward navigation, while EasyJet leverages interactive visuals for an engaging user experience. This analysis demonstrates the importance of tailored visualisation strategies in enhancing user interaction on travel websites.
