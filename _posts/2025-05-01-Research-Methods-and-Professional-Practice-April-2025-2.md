## Malware (ACM Case Studies)

In the ACM case study titled “Malware”, a web hosting company discovers that one of its clients is distributing malicious software but chooses not to take immediate action, fearing revenue loss. This raises significant ethical concerns, especially regarding ACM Code Principle 1.2 (Avoid harm) and 1.3 (Be honest and trustworthy) (ACM, 2018). Hosting malware endangers users globally, violating trust and potentially enabling cybercrime.

From a legal perspective, knowingly supporting or failing to report malicious activity could make the hosting provider complicit in criminal acts under computer misuse and cybercrime laws, such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (U.S.) or UK Computer Misuse Act 1990. Additionally, hosting malware may lead to GDPR violations if user data is compromised.

The social implications are severe. Malware harms not just individuals but also public trust in digital infrastructure. This erodes the very fabric of digital society and damages the credibility of IT professionals.

According to the BCS Code of Conduct, members must “have due regard for public health, privacy, security and well-being of others” and not knowingly support unethical practices (BCS, 2023). Unlike the company’s stance in the case, a BCS member would be obligated to report such misconduct and, if ignored, escalate or resign.

This case highlights how professional ethics go beyond profitability. Both ACM and BCS emphasize that the public interest and prevention of harm must be central to the responsibilities of computing professionals. Ignoring malware for revenue reflects a dangerous prioritization of business over ethics.

## Malware (ACM Case Studies)

The ACM case study “Malware” presents an ethical dilemma where a web hosting company chooses not to act after discovering one of its clients is distributing malicious software. This inaction, driven by a desire to avoid revenue loss, directly violates core principles of the ACM Code of Ethics, specifically 1.2 (Avoid harm) and 1.3 (Be honest and trustworthy) (ACM, 2018). By knowingly allowing malware to persist, the company jeopardizes the safety of users worldwide and contributes to the broader threat of cybercrime.

From a legal perspective, this decision could constitute a breach of multiple laws. Under the UK Computer Misuse Act 1990 or the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, knowingly facilitating or failing to report the distribution of malware can result in criminal liability (UK Government, 1990; U.S. DOJ, 2020). Furthermore, if personal data is compromised, the company could face severe penalties under GDPR, which emphasizes security by design and accountability in data processing.

As highlighted by my peers, this situation underscores the erosion of public trust in digital infrastructure. Linga Kanuri rightly noted that ethical lapses often stem from a lack of internal accountability or escalation channels. If IT professionals are silenced or unsupported, misconduct can persist unchecked. This places further ethical responsibility on individual professionals to act—even if that means whistleblowing or resigning.

From a social standpoint, Shaikah Alharthi astutely emphasized that the consequences are multi-dimensional: beyond personal harm, malware threatens financial systems and weakens the credibility of the IT industry as a whole. Public confidence is fundamental to the functioning of digital services, and corporate decisions driven solely by profit undermine this trust.

The BCS Code of Conduct complements the ACM principles by requiring members to “have due regard for public health, privacy, security and well-being of others” (BCS, 2023). Both codes agree that professionals must act in the public interest, not be complicit in unethical practices, and take action if misconduct is ignored. This includes escalation or, as a last resort, resignation to maintain professional integrity.

This case illustrates that professional ethics extend beyond compliance or profitability. Computing professionals are stewards of public trust and must prioritize harm prevention, transparency, and accountability. Companies must also embed ethical governance into their decision-making processes—through clear escalation pathways, ethical training, and internal checks—to ensure that short-term profits do not override long-term societal responsibilities.
