## Malware (ACM Case Studies)

In the ACM case study titled “Malware”, a web hosting company discovers that one of its clients is distributing malicious software but chooses not to take immediate action, fearing revenue loss. This raises significant ethical concerns, especially regarding ACM Code Principle 1.2 (Avoid harm) and 1.3 (Be honest and trustworthy) (ACM, 2018). Hosting malware endangers users globally, violating trust and potentially enabling cybercrime.

From a legal perspective, knowingly supporting or failing to report malicious activity could make the hosting provider complicit in criminal acts under computer misuse and cybercrime laws, such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (U.S.) or UK Computer Misuse Act 1990. Additionally, hosting malware may lead to GDPR violations if user data is compromised.

The social implications are severe. Malware harms not just individuals but also public trust in digital infrastructure. This erodes the very fabric of digital society and damages the credibility of IT professionals.

According to the BCS Code of Conduct, members must “have due regard for public health, privacy, security and well-being of others” and not knowingly support unethical practices (BCS, 2023). Unlike the company’s stance in the case, a BCS member would be obligated to report such misconduct and, if ignored, escalate or resign.

This case highlights how professional ethics go beyond profitability. Both ACM and BCS emphasize that the public interest and prevention of harm must be central to the responsibilities of computing professionals. Ignoring malware for revenue reflects a dangerous prioritization of business over ethics.
