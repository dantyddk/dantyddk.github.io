# Literature Review: The Use of Dashboards in Current Business Practice in the Ride-Hailing Sector
---

## 1. Introduction: Focus and Aim of the Review

This literature review explores the application, benefits, and challenges of dashboards in the ride-hailing industry. It aims to examine how dashboards support data-driven decision-making, improve operational efficiency, and enhance customer experience in companies such as Uber, Lyft, and Be Group. The intended audience includes researchers in data science and business analytics, as well as industry professionals seeking to understand the strategic importance of dashboards in this sector.

## 2. Significance of the Topic

Ride-hailing services operate in a highly competitive, data-intensive environment where real-time decision-making is critical. Dashboards serve as vital tools that provide visual analytics, enabling managers and stakeholders to monitor KPIs such as GMV, driver availability, trip volume, user retention, and churn rate. With the rise of AI and real-time data processing, dashboards are more important than ever in helping companies gain strategic advantages through insight generation (Few, 2021; Chen et al., 2020).

## 3. Context and Framework

The ride-hailing sector represents a dynamic, on-demand market where user behavior, regulatory frameworks, and pricing models can vary weekly or even daily. This review applies the Information-Action Framework (Shneiderman, 2022), which focuses on how information presentation leads to action through insights. We also draw upon the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) lens to evaluate dashboard usability and adoption in operational contexts (Preece et al., 2019).

## 4. Source Selection and Methodology

A systematic approach was employed to select peer-reviewed journal articles, industry whitepapers, and key textbooks published between 2015 and 2024. Databases such as Scopus, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect were searched using terms like “dashboards in transportation analytics,” “ride-hailing KPIs,” “real-time decision-making dashboards,” and “HCI in operational dashboards.” Sources were selected based on relevance, recency, credibility, and citation impact.

## 5. Structure of the Review

- The review is organized thematically as follows:
- Role of dashboards in decision-making
- Types of metrics and KPIs used in ride-hailing dashboards
- Technical and design considerations
- Challenges and limitations
- Future directions

## 6. Key Findings

### 6.1 Decision-Making Support

Dashboards serve as centralized control panels where data from various operational systems are aggregated and visualized. Studies have shown that real-time dashboards significantly improve fleet allocation, dynamic pricing, and customer support responsiveness (Kumar & Sinha, 2021; Zhu et al., 2022).

### 6.2 KPIs and Metrics

Commonly tracked metrics include Active Riders, GMV, Completed Trips, Revenue per Rider, and %Burn (Zhang et al., 2020). Persona segmentation—classifying users into groups like commuters, students, and high-frequency users—enables targeted interventions. Modern dashboards often integrate machine learning models to predict demand surges and churn probabilities (Chen et al., 2020).

### 6.3 Design and Interactivity

Effective dashboards follow principles of clarity, consistency, and minimalism (Few, 2021). Features like dropdown filters, trendlines, treemaps, and stacked bar charts enable users to explore the data flexibly. Tableau and Power BI are the most commonly used platforms, praised for their integration capabilities and user-friendly interfaces (Wang & Yu, 2022).

### 6.4 HCI Considerations

Human-centered design is crucial. Dashboards must be easy to navigate, accommodate different user roles (analyst, operations manager, executive), and minimize cognitive load. Studies emphasize the importance of interactive tooltips, responsive visual feedback, and mobile compatibility for field operations (Preece et al., 2019; Ware, 2021).

## 7. Strengths and Limitations of the Literature

Most studies agree that dashboards offer quantifiable business benefits. However, there is often a lack of empirical data on long-term adoption and ROI in ride-hailing-specific contexts. While platforms like Uber and Grab have published technical papers, small and mid-sized operators are underrepresented in the literature. Furthermore, dashboard usability studies tend to focus on generic business environments rather than sector-specific HCI challenges.

## 8. Discrepancies in the Literature

One key area of divergence lies in the debate between real-time dashboards vs. strategic reporting dashboards. Some researchers advocate for continuous streaming dashboards, while others emphasize weekly or monthly aggregation for strategic planning (Sharma & Dasgupta, 2023). There’s also variation in how “user segmentation” is defined—some use demographics, others behavioral patterns.

## 9. Conclusion and Future Recommendations

The literature confirms that dashboards are indispensable in the modern ride-hailing ecosystem. They provide clarity, support faster decisions, and improve cross-departmental communication. However, more sector-specific HCI research is needed, especially in emerging markets like Southeast Asia. Future studies should also explore the integration of predictive analytics, natural language processing, and personalization in dashboard design.

## Recommended Actions

- Develop user-centered dashboards with input from all stakeholder roles
- Conduct usability testing across different user groups (e.g., dispatchers vs. executives)
- Integrate AI-powered alerts and forecasts for proactive decision-making
- Standardize KPI definitions across departments to enable consistent tracking
