### Reflection On Each Activites

#### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA activity allowed me to explore datasets systematically, using Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib to identify trends and clean data effectively. I learned to detect missing values, handle outliers using the interquartile range (IQR), and understand data distributions through this. A highlight was understanding the implications of skewed data, which required transformations to align with statistical models.

In the Airbnb group project, I applied these techniques to clean the dataset of outliers like luxury property prices above $10,000. This process ensured the reliability of subsequent clustering models. This activity enhanced my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights, an essential skill for real-world data science applications.

#### 2. Correlation Analysis

Correlation analysis was a valuable exercise in identifying relationships between variables. By using correlation matrices, I gained the ability to pinpoint associations like the negative correlation between room type and price in the Airbnb dataset. This understanding guided feature selection for clustering.
This skill was applied in the team project, where weak correlations helped determine the influence of host characteristics on pricing. For instance, hosts with multiple listings did not significantly impact price trends, reshaping our clustering strategy. This reinforced the importance of data-driven decision-making in model building.

#### 3. Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn

This activity provided an opportunity to implement and evaluate linear regression models using Scikit-Learn. I learned to split data into training and testing sets and evaluate model performance through metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The practical insights into overfitting and underfitting were particularly enlightening.

During the individual project, I implemented regression models to predict price trends in the Airbnb dataset. Although linear regression was limited in capturing non-linear relationships, it served as a baseline model, highlighting the need for advanced machine learning techniques like clustering and neural networks.

#### 4. Clustering Techniques

Learning clustering algorithms, particularly k-means, deepened my understanding of unsupervised learning. The activity emphasized the importance of selecting the optimal number of clusters using methods like the elbow technique and silhouette scores. Encoding categorical data numerically was also critical for accurate clustering.

In the team project, clustering was pivotal in segmenting listings into distinct groups, such as luxury, budget-friendly, and high-availability categories. These clusters informed pricing strategies tailored to each segment, demonstrating how clustering aligns with business objectives. This activity solidified my ability to extract actionable insights from unsupervised learning.

#### 5. Perceptron Activities

The perceptron activity introduced me to the foundations of neural networks, including binary classification and weight updates through gradient descent. Understanding activation functions like sigmoid and ReLU was essential to grasp the complexity of multilayer perceptrons.
While this activity was theoretical, it enhanced my ability to conceptualize advanced neural networks. This knowledge was indirectly applied during the individual project when evaluating the feasibility of using neural networks for complex pricing predictions.

#### 6. K-Means Clustering Tutorial

The k-means clustering tutorial emphasized practical applications of clustering algorithms in grouping similar data points. I learned how to preprocess data, calculate centroids, and evaluate cluster quality using silhouette scores. Additionally, the tutorial highlighted the importance of scaling numerical features to ensure clustering accuracy.

In the team project, k-means clustering played a crucial role in segmenting Airbnb properties. For instance, clusters were created based on price, availability, and location, which informed marketing strategies tailored to specific customer demographics. This hands-on experience enhanced my ability to employ clustering in real-world scenarios.

#### 7. Emerging Research in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

This activity focused on understanding current trends and challenges in ANN development, such as interpretability, model optimization, and ethical considerations. I explored advanced topics like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for complex tasks like image recognition and time-series forecasting.
Although the team project didn’t directly involve ANNs, this activity expanded my awareness of future applications, such as using ANNs to predict customer behavior in ride-hailing or real estate pricing. It also reinforced the importance of staying updated with advancements to remain competitive in the AI field.

#### 8. Gradient Descent and Cost Function

The gradient descent activity provided insights into optimizing model performance by minimizing the cost function. I learned about hyperparameter tuning, such as adjusting the learning rate, and the impact of convergence speed on model efficiency.
This concept was indirectly applied during the individual project, where I used iterative processes to improve the clustering model’s performance. Understanding gradient descent deepened my appreciation for optimization techniques, even in non-linear models like clustering and decision trees.

#### 9. CNN Model Activity & Tutorial

The CNN tutorial introduced me to the structure and functioning of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and activation functions. This activity demonstrated how CNNs are tailored for image recognition tasks, emphasizing their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in data.
Although CNNs weren’t directly applied in the Airbnb project, the activity broadened my understanding of deep learning models, which could be explored in future applications like image-based property classification for real estate platforms.

#### 10. Model Performance Measurement

This activity covered key performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. By evaluating model predictions against ground truth, I developed a structured approach to assessing model effectiveness.
In the individual project, these metrics helped evaluate clustering quality and ensured the model’s alignment with project objectives. For example, assessing intra-cluster distances validated the segmentation approach. This knowledge is fundamental for refining machine learning pipelines in future projects.

#### 11. Legal and Ethical Views on ANN Applications

This activity highlighted the ethical considerations of using ANNs, such as fairness, bias mitigation, and transparency. Discussions focused on responsible AI practices, including data privacy and compliance with legal frameworks like GDPR.

These principles were applied in the team project to ensure fair treatment of customer data in the Airbnb dataset. For example, we took care to anonymize host and guest information during preprocessing. This activity reinforced the importance of ethical considerations in AI development, which will guide my future work.

#### 12. Airbnb Group Project

The Airbnb project was the culmination of the module, allowing us to apply multiple concepts, such as EDA, clustering, and ethical data handling. My contributions included data cleaning, feature engineering, and implementing k-means clustering to segment listings. These segments informed actionable recommendations, such as adjusting pricing strategies for different customer groups.

Working collaboratively provided insights into team dynamics, conflict resolution, and the importance of clear communication. Using GitHub for version control and documentation streamlined our workflow and ensured transparency. This experience strengthened my ability to manage group projects effectively and demonstrated the real-world relevance of machine learning techniques.

#### 13. Individual Project Presentation

The Individual Project involved creating a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to address a real-world problem. This project provided an opportunity to work independently and apply concepts like EDA, clustering, and model evaluation in a structured framework. My focus was on analyzing the Airbnb dataset to design an optimized pricing strategy based on customer and listing features.

I explored various machine learning techniques, starting with EDA to clean and preprocess the data. Handling missing values and transforming skewed data distributions were essential steps to ensure model accuracy. I implemented clustering algorithms, such as k-means, to segment listings into distinct groups based on features like price and location. These clusters provided actionable insights for tailoring pricing strategies.

A key challenge was selecting the optimal number of clusters, which I resolved using the elbow method and silhouette scores. This iterative process required a combination of technical knowledge and critical thinking. Another challenge was interpreting clustering results in a way that informed business decisions, which enhanced my data storytelling skills.

Through this project, I improved my Python programming skills, particularly in using libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. Additionally, I deepened my understanding of model evaluation metrics and their role in refining machine learning workflows. The independent nature of this project strengthened my ability to manage time, prioritize tasks, and deliver a solution aligned with stakeholder expectations.

The skills gained in this project are directly applicable to professional scenarios. For instance, I can now approach business problems with a systematic pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. This project has also prepared me to work autonomously while meeting project goals, an essential skill for real-world machine-learning roles.
