# Inappropriate Use of Surveys
---

## Introduction

Surveys are a common tool for collecting user insights, preferences, and opinions. However, when survey data is misused—especially without informed consent—it raises critical concerns regarding privacy, ethics, legality, and professional responsibility. The Cambridge Analytica scandal remains the most prominent example of the inappropriate use of surveys in the digital age, but it is not the only one.

### Case Study 1: Cambridge Analytica and Facebook (2018)

In 2018, The New York Times and The Observer revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, had harvested the personal data of over 87 million Facebook users through a personality quiz app called "thisisyourdigitallife" (Confessore, 2018). While only about 270,000 users directly interacted with the quiz, the app exploited Facebook’s API to collect data from users' friends as well, without their consent.

This data was later used to build psychological profiles of voters, targeting them with political advertisements during the Brexit referendum and the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

### Case Study 2: TikTok's Personality Test & Shadow Profiling

In 2021, several cybersecurity analysts flagged concerns about third-party apps linked to TikTok that requested users to take seemingly harmless “personality” or “compatibility” quizzes. These surveys requested access to contact lists, location data, and device usage statistics. Despite appearing informal and fun, the collected data was used for building shadow profiles of non-users and was potentially monetised by third parties without adequate transparency or user consent (Mozur, 2021).

## Ethical Considerations

Both cases raise serious ethical issues:
- **Informed Consent**: Users were not made fully aware of the scope of data collection, nor of how their data—or that of their friends—would be used. This violates principles in the ACM Code of Ethics (2018) and BCS Code of Conduct (2023), particularly concerning honesty and transparency.
-** Manipulation and Deception**: The surveys were presented as benign, but were used as tools for political targeting or commercial profiling. This is unethical and constitutes deceptive data practices.
- **Exploitation of Trust**: These cases show how the psychological trust users place in social media platforms and apps can be abused for hidden agendas.

## Social Impacts

- **Erosion of Trust**: Public trust in tech companies significantly declined after Cambridge Analytica, leading to user backlash, social media boycotts, and calls for platform accountability.
- **Polarisation**: In the political realm, microtargeting based on psychographic profiles contributed to misinformation, voter manipulation, and greater political division.
- **Surveillance Culture**: The misuse of innocuous surveys normalised a culture of surveillance under the guise of engagement, particularly among younger users.

## Legal Implications

- **Data Protection Violation**s: In both cases, GDPR (in Europe) and CCPA (in California) would consider the data collection practices unlawful due to lack of explicit, informed consent and transparency.
- Facebook was fined £500,000 by the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)—the maximum penalty at the time—for failing to safeguard user data during the Cambridge Analytica incident.
- In the TikTok case, investigations in the EU and U.S. continue regarding violations of children’s data privacy, under laws such as COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act).

## Professional Responsibility

Under the ACM Code of Ethics, professionals must:
- “Avoid harm” (Principle 1.2),
- “Be honest and trustworthy” (1.3), and
- “Respect privacy” (1.6).
Similarly, the BCS Code of Conduct expects members to “have due regard for the privacy, rights and interests of others.” Developers and data scientists involved in these cases failed to uphold these responsibilities by designing and deploying systems that concealed their true intent.

## Conclusion and Reflection

The misuse of surveys in digital platforms poses significant risks to ethical and professional standards in computing. The Cambridge Analytica scandal set a precedent that continues to inform data governance debates worldwide. Newer examples like the TikTok quiz apps indicate that the risk persists, particularly as users grow accustomed to sharing personal data through playful, gamified interfaces.

These incidents reinforce the need for robust ethical training, transparent system design, and enforceable legal frameworks. As a computing professional in training, I recognize the importance of questioning not only how we collect data—but why and for what purpose. Moving forward, I aim to apply critical thinking and uphold ethical principles when dealing with user data in any project or product I help develop.
