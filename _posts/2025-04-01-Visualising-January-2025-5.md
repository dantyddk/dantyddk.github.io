##  Reflective Entry: Applying AR/VR in Data Visualisation for Future Employment
---

The integration of AR/VR technologies into data visualisation represents a transformative shift in how we understand and interact with complex datasets. As a healthcare professional with a growing interest in data analytics, I see immense potential for these immersive tools in improving both patient outcomes and clinical decision-making.

According to Nichols (2019), VR and AR allow users to explore data in a three-dimensional, spatial context, making it easier to identify patterns and anomalies. For example, visualising patient fertility metrics or treatment responses in a 3D environment could help the clinical team at Khang Trí Clinic personalise interventions and improve communication with patients.

Kurbatov (2017) highlights the importance of considering human cognitive limitations in VR environments. This insight is crucial—especially in healthcare—where data visualisations must be designed to reduce cognitive overload and enhance clarity. By keeping the human factor in mind, I can help ensure AR/VR tools are user-friendly for both medical professionals and patients.

Dalton (2016) further argues that VR enhances storytelling and fosters collaboration, which is increasingly relevant in remote or interdisciplinary medical teams. In future roles, I envision using VR platforms for collaborative analysis of large health datasets, such as those from clinical trials or public health initiatives, enabling more effective and engaging virtual teamwork.

In summary, AR/VR data visualisation offers promising opportunities to transform how we interpret, share, and act on data in healthcare settings. I plan to explore these tools further and advocate for their integration in clinical practice.
